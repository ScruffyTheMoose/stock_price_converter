`Stock Price Converter` is a learning project to better understand Javascript. This program makes calls to two separate APIs and returns the price of a given stock in the requested currency.

### Learning objectives:
* Proper use of async functions
* Application of arrow functions
* Taking advantage of Axios simplicity for code readability and functionality
* Understand use of async/await/then

The main module has detailed comments and includes two free API keys that were taken from their respective APIs. Feel free to use any of the code in the project for your own learning or work!
